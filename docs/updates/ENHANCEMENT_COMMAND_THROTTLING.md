# Enhancement: Command Throttling & Brute Force Protection

## Overview
This enhancement implements **advanced rate limiting and command throttling** to prevent spam and brute force attacks against the access control system. This addresses the **security** requirement by adding comprehensive protection against malicious usage patterns while maintaining full **in-memory compliance**.

## � Security Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Layer Rate Limiting
- **Per-User Rate Limiting**: Maximum attempts per minute per user/device combination
- **Brute Force Protection**: Automatic lockout after consecutive failed attempts
- **Smart Throttling**: Different rules for general usage vs. attack patterns
- **Physical Button Protection**: ESP32 buttons are also rate limited

### 2. Configurable Security Policies
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: All limits configurable via .env files
- **Flexible Timeouts**: Customizable lockout periods and cleanup intervals
- **Production Ready**: Different settings for development vs. production environments

### 3. Real-time Monitoring
- **Live Statistics**: Track attempts, success/failure rates, and active users
- **Individual User Status**: Check specific user lockout status and remaining time
- **Administrative Controls**: Clear rate limiter data and manage security policies

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Rate Limiting Algorithm
```python
class RateLimiter:
    def check_rate_limit(self, device_id: str, user_id: str, command: str):
        # 1. Check brute force protection (failed attempts)
        recent_failed = self._get_recent_failed_attempts(device_id, user_id, now)
        if len(recent_failed) >= self.max_failed_attempts:
            # User is locked out for X minutes
            return False, "Too many failed attempts"
        
        # 2. Check general rate limiting (all attempts)
        recent_attempts = self._get_recent_attempts(device_id, user_id, now)
        if len(recent_attempts) >= self.max_attempts_per_minute:
            return False, "Rate limit exceeded"
        
        return True, "Allowed"
```

### Integration Points
- **Access Control Service**: All access attempts are rate limited before processing
- **Physical Button Handler**: ESP32 button presses are throttled
- **WebSocket Commands**: Real-time commands include rate limiting
- **API Endpoints**: REST API calls are protected

## 📊 Configuration Options

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Rate Limiting Configuration
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_MINUTE=5      # Max attempts per minute per user
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS=3          # Failed attempts before lockout
RATE_LIMIT_LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES=5     # Lockout duration in minutes
RATE_LIMIT_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES=60    # Memory cleanup interval
```

### Default Security Policy
- **5 attempts per minute** - Prevents rapid-fire attempts
- **3 failed attempts** - Triggers brute force protection
- **5-minute lockout** - Temporary ban after too many failures
- **24-hour data retention** - Automatic memory cleanup

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

### Attack Prevention
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Automatic lockout after repeated failures
- **Credential Stuffing**: Rate limiting prevents automated login attempts
- **DoS Protection**: Prevents overwhelming the system with requests
- **Physical Security**: ESP32 button spam is blocked

### Operational Security
- **Audit Trail**: All attempts are logged with timestamps
- **Real-time Alerts**: Failed attempts appear in access logs
- **Administrative Control**: Clear blocked users or adjust policies
- **Compliance**: Rate limiting data helps with security audits

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

  }
}
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Security Monitoring
- **GET /api/security/rate_limiter/stats** - Overall rate limiter statistics
- **GET /api/security/rate_limiter/user_status** - Check specific user status
- **DELETE /api/security/rate_limiter/clear** - Clear all rate limiter data (admin)

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Check system-wide rate limiting stats
curl http://localhost:5000/api/security/rate_limiter/stats

# Check if a specific user is locked out
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/security/rate_limiter/user_status?device_id=DOOR-001&user_id=testuser"

# Clear all rate limiting data (emergency admin function)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/security/rate_limiter/clear
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Core Rate Limiter (`services/rate_limiter.py`)
```python
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_attempts_per_minute = 5  # General rate limit
        self.max_failed_attempts = 3      # Brute force threshold
        self.lockout_duration_minutes = 5 # Lockout period
        
    def check_rate_limit(self, device_id: str, user_id: str, command: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        # Check for lockout due to failed attempts
        # Check for general rate limiting
        # Return (allowed, reason)
```

### Integration Points
- **Access Control Service**: Pre-validation in `process_access_attempt()`
- **Physical Button Handler**: Protection against button spam
- **API Endpoints**: Rate limiting on all access requests
- **WebSocket Commands**: Real-time rate limit enforcement

### Security Configuration
```python
# Rate Limiting Configuration
MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_MINUTE = 5    # Prevent rapid-fire attacks
MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS = 3        # Brute force threshold
LOCKOUT_DURATION = 5 minutes   # Cooling-off period
CLEANUP_INTERVAL = 60 minutes  # Memory management
```

## 🚨 **Attack Prevention Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: API Brute Force Attack
```bash
# Attacker tries multiple rapid attempts
POST /api/access_log {"device_id": "DOOR-001", "user_card_id": "hacker", "command": "open"}
POST /api/access_log {"device_id": "DOOR-001", "user_card_id": "hacker", "command": "open"}
POST /api/access_log {"device_id": "DOOR-001", "user_card_id": "hacker", "command": "open"}

# Result: User "hacker" locked out for 5 minutes
Response: {"message": "Rate Limited: Too many failed attempts. Locked out for 297 seconds"}
```

### Scenario 2: Physical Button Spam
```cpp
// ESP32 button pressed rapidly
button_press() -> WebSocket -> Rate Limiter
button_press() -> WebSocket -> Rate Limiter  
button_press() -> WebSocket -> BLOCKED

// Result: Button commands denied with rate limit message
```

### Scenario 3: Legitimate User Protection
```bash
# Admin user can still work while attacker is blocked
POST /api/access_log {"user_card_id": "admin", "command": "unlock"} 
# ✅ SUCCESS - Different user, not rate limited
```
