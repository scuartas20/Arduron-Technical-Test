# ESP32 Connection Status Detection - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
When you turned off the ESP32, the backend server still thought the device was connected because there was no mechanism to detect abrupt disconnections.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Added Connection Status Tracking
- Added `ConnectionStatus` enum: `ONLINE`, `OFFLINE`, `UNKNOWN`
- Added `connection_status` field to Door model
- Physical devices start as `OFFLINE`, virtual devices as `ONLINE`

#### Implemented Heartbeat Mechanism
- **Ping/Pong System**: Server sends ping every 10 seconds to connected devices
- **Timeout Detection**: If device doesn't respond within 30 seconds, it's marked as disconnected
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Disconnected devices are removed from active connections
- **Status Broadcasting**: Connection status changes are broadcasted to all frontend clients

#### New API Endpoints
```
GET /api/devices/connections          # All device connections
GET /api/devices/{id}/connection      # Specific device connection
```

#### Enhanced Existing Endpoints
- `/api/devices/status` now includes `connection_status` field

### 2. ESP32 Changes Required

#### Added Ping/Pong Response Handler
```cpp
// New function to respond to server pings
void sendPongResponse() {
    // Sends pong response to maintain connection
    // Includes brief LED blink as heartbeat indicator
}

// Added in message handler
else if (type == "ping") {
    sendPongResponse();
}
```

#### Visual Heartbeat Indicator
- Both LEDs briefly flash when responding to ping
- Shows the device is actively communicating with server

## How It Works

### Normal Operation
1. ESP32 connects → Server marks device as `ONLINE`
2. Server sends ping every 10 seconds
3. ESP32 responds with pong
4. Server updates last ping time
5. Frontend shows device as connected

### Disconnection Detection
1. ESP32 loses power/connection
2. Server continues sending pings (fails silently)
3. After 30 seconds without pong response:
   - Device marked as `OFFLINE`
   - Removed from active connections
   - Status change broadcasted to frontend
4. Frontend immediately shows device as disconnected

### Reconnection
1. ESP32 comes back online
2. Connects to WebSocket endpoint
3. Server marks device as `ONLINE`
4. Status change broadcasted to frontend

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Update ESP32 Code
Upload the modified `esp32_updated_handler.cpp` to your ESP32

### 2. Monitor Connection Status
```powershell
# Run this PowerShell script to monitor in real-time
.\monitor_connections.ps1
```

### 3. Test Disconnection
1. Turn on ESP32 → Should show as ONLINE within seconds
2. Turn off ESP32 → Should show as OFFLINE within 30 seconds
3. Turn on ESP32 again → Should show as ONLINE immediately

### 4. API Testing
```powershell
# Check all device statuses (includes connection_status)
Invoke-RestMethod "http://localhost:5000/api/devices/status"

# Check specific device connection
Invoke-RestMethod "http://localhost:5000/api/devices/DOOR-001/connection"

# Monitor all WebSocket connections
Invoke-RestMethod "http://localhost:5000/api/devices/connections"
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Real-time Detection**: Server knows device status within 30 seconds
2. **Reliable Communication**: Ping/pong ensures connection health
3. **Visual Feedback**: LED heartbeat on ESP32 shows active communication
4. **API Transparency**: Connection status visible in all relevant endpoints
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Reconnection handled seamlessly
6. **Frontend Updates**: Real-time status updates via WebSocket broadcasting

## Configuration
- **Ping Interval**: 10 seconds (configurable in `websocket_manager.py`)
- **Timeout Threshold**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Heartbeat LED Duration**: 50ms flash (configurable in ESP32 code)

The system now provides robust connection monitoring and will accurately reflect when your ESP32 device is actually connected or disconnected.
